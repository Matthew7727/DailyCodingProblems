# Daily Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Daily Coding Challenges repository! This repository is dedicated to solving coding challenges on a daily basis using different programming languages. Each day, a new challenge will be added, complete with a description and solution file.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main section:

- `challenges/`: Contains subfolders for each challenge. Each subfolder is named with the challenge number (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.).

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigating Challenges**:
   - Go to the `challenges/` folder.
   - Select the challenge by number (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).
   - Open the `description.json` file to read the challenge details.
   - Review the solution file for the implementation in the specified language.

## Adding a New Challenge

To add a new challenge:

1. Create a new subfolder in the `challenges/` directory named with the challenge number (e.g., `4`).
2. Add a `description.json` file with the challenge details.
3. Create a solution file named `solution.<language_extension>` (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`, `solution.js`) based on the language specified in the `description.json`.
