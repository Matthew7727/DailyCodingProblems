    "description": "The 'look and say' sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term 1 , each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221. As an example, the fourth term is 1211 , since the third term consists of one 2 and one 1.
